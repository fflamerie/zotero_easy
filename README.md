## Agenda published on URFIST de Bordeaux website

Tired of manually writing and formatting your bibliographic references? Of reorganizing your bibliography every time you insert a new citation? Weary of dealing with the dispersal and lack of links between your bibliographic references, your PDFs, your notes, etc.?

Zotero is a robust, reliable, free and open-source reference manager, and even more a personal research assistant.

It makes easy and automatic all stages of bibliographic work, from importing references to citing them in a document, by generating citations or footnotes as well as the bibliography. Thanks to Zotero, you build a consistent and organized database and make the most of it in a single click in multiple contexts. Zotero also integrates a PDF reader, enabling you to annotate PDFs, generate notes from these annotations and finally insert these notes and associated citations directly into your word processing document.

By the end of the course, participants will have mastered Zotero's interface and main features. They will also be able to identify the resources available to go ahead further with Zotero by their own : forum, documentation, plugins, etc.

* Installing and setting up Zotero
* Building your Zotero library by adding bibliographic references from a variety of sources (online databases, library catalogs, PDF files, etc.) and attaching files
* Organizing all contents of your Zotero library, from bibliographic references to annotations
* Identifying and installing in Zotero the relevant citation styles for your field
* Citing with Zotero: focus on the word processor plugins for inserting citations and the corresponding bibliography with Word, LibreOffice and Google Docs
